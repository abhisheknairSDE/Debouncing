2. Open index.html file in the browser.

3. You will see an input field and a "Debounced Increment" button. As you type in the input field and click the button, you will observe how debouncing affects the function execution.

## Usage

Click the "Debounced Increment" button.
Observe how the "Increment" function is called only after a brief pause (debouncing) following the button click.
